## ✨ Functionalities

### 🛫 Runway Performance Analysis
Calculate whether your runway is long enough for the conditions you'll face:
- **POH-Based Calculations** — runway length requirements computed directly from your aircraft's Pilot Operating Handbook data using fitted regression models
- **Multi-Factor Corrections** — accounts for temperature, pressure altitude, aircraft weight, wind, runway surface, slope, and operational safety margins
- **Threshold & 50 ft Obstacle Distances** — both ground roll and obstacle clearance distances computed
- **Real-Time Updates** — performance figures refresh instantly as you adjust any input

### 🌤️ Weather Integration
Stay current with live aviation weather:
- **Live METAR Retrieval** — automatic fetching from the nearest reporting station
- **TAF Support** — trend forecasts for destination planning
- **Cloud Ceiling Charts** — interactive visualisation of cloud layers with circuit and CTR altitude overlays
- **Wind Envelope Analysis** — visual crosswind and headwind assessment across a range of wind conditions, so you can see your margins at a glance

### ⚖️ Weight & Balance
Ensure your aircraft is loaded within its certified envelope:
- **Interactive CG Charts** — plot your centre of gravity against the aircraft envelope in real time
- **Multiple Scenarios** — validate departure weight, landing weight, and custom loading states side by side
- **Dynamic Recalculation** — automatic updates as fuel burn and passenger weights change
- **Instant Compliance Feedback** — clear indication when any configuration falls outside limits

### 🗺️ Aerodrome Information
Everything you need to know about your departure and arrival airfields:
- **Comprehensive Database** — runway dimensions, surface types, frequencies, and elevation data
- **Runway Diagrams** — SVG-based runway layout visualisations colour-coded by surface type
- **ATC Frequencies** — tower, ground, approach, radio, ATIS, and information frequencies at a glance
- **Custom Annotations** — add your own notes, images, parking preferences, and circuit patterns per aerodrome
- **Route & Circuit Planning** — store entry/exit points, altitudes, and local procedures for each field

### 📊 Visual Analytics
Make sense of data through clear, interactive charts:
- **Performance Curves** — fitted regression models visualised alongside raw POH data points
- **Weather Charts** — cloud coverage timelines and wind component diagrams
- **Interactive Maps** — aerodrome location mapping for route overview

## 🎯 Who is it for?

SkyWalk is designed for **private pilots, flight students, and flying club members** who want a modern, digital alternative to manual pre-flight calculations. It is equally useful as a **teaching tool** for instructors explaining runway performance and weather interpretation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

SkyWalk is intended for **educational and planning purposes only**. It is not certified for operational flight planning. Always cross-check calculations against your official aircraft POH and consult current NOTAMs, charts, and official weather sources. Pilots remain solely responsible for all flight planning decisions.
